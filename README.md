# Title:

## Build an Api using Nodejs, Discord and Twitter Developer Api Documentation where if someone messages “Tweet my message” on discord channel. You should take input from that user and tweet it.



# Project's Description:

## What this application does ->
> ### So, the application basically read our input from discord when we type a tweet (our tweet should start from 'Tweet my message-') and when the bot responds with 'Done! Please check your twitter' , that means it worked successfully.

## Why you used the technologies you used ->
> ### we used nodejs to build our apps because twitter and discord they both have their modules named 'twit' and 'discord.js' respectively so that we can directly interact with thier APIs.
